# Game Time - Snake

## About:

This is a vesion of the classic arcade game Snake, built out using JavaScript and the HTML Canvas.  In this game, you have 5 lives, and you have to eat as many blocks of food (and accumulate as many points as you can - each food brick eaten equals 10 points) before you die.  If you hit the wall, or yourself, you die and lose a life.  The game gets faster every time your score increases by 50.
